echo  You mull her offer over for a moment before deciding to pursue the sweet
echo  nectar dripping from her exposed sex. She leans back in her flower, 
echo  spreading her legs obscenely and pulling an empty vial out from a tiny 
echo  pack that sits on the ground.
echo.
echo  Here, take thizzz, she says, handing you the
echo  crystal vial, When I cum you will want to zzzave the excess honey... once
echo  it has cooled, it will be able to do amazzzing thingzzz to... for you. You
echo  take the vial absently as you kneel between her legs and take in deep 
echo  breaths of the scent. It fills your head and groin with its warmth and 
echo  sticky sweetness. You part your lips, leaning ever closer to her delicate
echo  flower, tensing with anticipation. When your tongue finally meets the 
echo  slickened surface of her vulva you swoon. The taste is better than 
echo  anything you ve ever experienced - sweet, pure, and yet totally sexual. 
echo  You dart over her clit, and are rewarded with a burst of heavenly 
echo  sweetness. The maddening taste of her ambrosia gets in your veins – you 
echo  NEED more and you attack her honeypot mercilessly, until at last she 
echo  squeals in orgasm, clamping her fuzz-covered thighs around your head.
echo  The force of her orgasm splatters you with the honey, far more than you
echo  could possibly try to lap up
echo.
echo.
echo.
