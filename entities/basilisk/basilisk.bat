echo  mountain peaks when a furious screech from high above you

echo  You are fighting a basilisk! From what you can tell while not 
echo  looking directly at it, the basilisk is a male reptilian biped
echo  standing a bit over 6' tall. It has a thin but ropy build, its 
echo  tightly muscled yellow underbelly the only part of its frame not 
echo  covered in those deceptive, camouflaging grey-green scales. A long,
echo  whip-like tail flits restlessly through the dirt behind its skinny 
echo  legs, and sharp sickle-shaped index claws decorate each hand and 
echo  foot. You don't dare to look at its face, but you have the 
echo  impression of a cruel jaw, a blunt lizard snout and a crown of dull 
echo  spines.
